EPIC 12: Applied Engineering Curriculum

Building Makers, Not Consumers

K-12 Engineering Track ΓÇö Students Build Their Own Devices

Version 1.0 ΓÇö December 2025

Part I: The Philosophy

"This is what colonialism took. The confidence that we can build things. The knowledge that technology is not magic from elsewhere ΓÇö it's engineering, and engineering can be learned."

Africa does not need more consumers of technology. Africa needs producers. Makers. Engineers. Problem solvers.

A child who has taken apart a radio at age 8, soldered their first circuit at 10, built their own phone at 14, and designed their own laptop at 16 ΓÇö that child does not fear technology. They own it.

They don't wait for someone from Europe to come fix the generator. They fix it themselves. They don't wonder how the water pump works. They can design one.

The SVA Engineering Covenant

Start early. Engineering begins in Kindergarten, not university.

Hands first. Theory follows practice, not the other way around.

Real projects. Not simulations ΓÇö working devices that students keep and use.

Vertical mentorship. Seniors teach juniors. Learning becomes teaching.

Economic dignity. Graduates have a trade, not just a certificate.

What Students Graduate With

A phone they built with their own hands

A laptop they designed and assembled

The skills to repair any device in their village

CAD, 3D printing, electronics, and programming skills

The confidence to start a business or pursue engineering

Experience teaching others ΓÇö the foundation of leadership

Grade 9-10 students who built phones mentor Grade 5-6 on micro:bit

Grade 7-8 help Grade 3-4 with circuit projects

Teaching is assessed ΓÇö it's how mastery is demonstrated

This is T0ΓåÆT1 teacher formation happening organically. A student who can build AND teach is ready to lead.



Part III: Phase 1 ΓÇö Explorers (K-2)

Theme: Curiosity, observation, fearlessness with technology

Core Philosophy

Before children can build, they must lose their fear of breaking. In these years, we systematically take things apart. Nothing is precious. Everything is a learning opportunity.

Yearly Progression

Vocabulary: battery, wire, motor, speaker, screen

Safety: what not to touch, how to ask for help

Grade 1: How Does It Move?

Projects:

Take apart wind-up toys ΓÇö discover gears and springs

Take apart battery toys ΓÇö find motors, switches, wires

Simple machines hunt: levers, wheels, pulleys in daily life

Build simple lever and pulley from sticks and string

Skills:

Observation: drawing what they see inside

Vocabulary: gear, spring, axle, motor, switch

Prediction: "what happens if I...?"

Grade 2: Where Does the Power Come From?

Projects:

Take apart flashlights ΓÇö complete circuit tracing

Take apart old radios (with supervision)

Battery experiments: what conducts, what doesn't

Build first circuit: battery + wire + LED

Capstone: Take-Apart Portfolio

Document 10 devices taken apart. For each: photo, parts list, "how I think it works."



Part IV: Phase 2 ΓÇö Circuit Builders (Grade 3-4)

Theme: From observation to creation ΓÇö building simple electronics

Core Philosophy

Now that students understand what's inside devices, they begin building. Every project works. Every student succeeds. The goal is confidence, not complexity.
