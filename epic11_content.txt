EPIC 11: SVA Education Device

Hardware Layer Specification

Addendum to SVA Vision Architecture & Cursor Specification

Version 1.0 ΓÇö December 2025

Executive Summary

This addendum specifies the SVA Education Device ΓÇö custom hardware designed to run the SVA Learning Operating System in resource-limited environments. The device ecosystem consists of two form factors:

SVA Phone: $50 rugged smartphone with solar trickle charging

SVA Laptop: $200 education laptop for productivity and coding

Combined cost per student: $250 (at scale: $180-200). Both devices run Kolibri for offline-first content delivery, syncing with Raspberry Pi hubs at learning centers.

Design principle: If it works in a refugee camp, it will work anywhere.



Part I: The Hardware Covenant

SVA controls the full stack. The software we build needs hardware to run on ΓÇö hardware that works when:

There's no reliable electricity for days

The internet hasn't worked in weeks

Dust, heat, and humidity destroy consumer devices

Repair technicians and spare parts don't exist locally

Students share devices with siblings and carry them kilometers to school

The SVA Education Device is the physical manifestation of offline-first architecture.

Non-Negotiables

Principle

Implementation

Days without power

4000mAh battery + solar trickle charging + USB-C fast charge

Weeks without internet

All content pre-loaded, sync when connectivity appears

Rugged for Africa

IP54 rating, rubberized TPU bumpers, 1m drop survival

Locally repairable

Standard components, snap-together shell, brass inserts

Affordable at scale

$50 phone / $200 laptop ΓÇö comparable to Chromebook economics

No surveillance

Locked down for education, no tracking beyond learning analytics
